These are the DAX formulas and also formulas included for excel file used to analyse and build Club report:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Data Preparation (must-do before dashboard)
A. Convert date columns to Date type

Columns to convert:

ClubStartDt

ClubOpenedDt

Presale_Date

Date_Opened

Excel

=DATEVALUE(A2)

Power BI (DAX – calculated column)

ClubOpenedDate = DATEVALUE('Clubs'[ClubOpenedDt])
B. Handle missing values

CIP_G_L → treat as 0 or blank (depending on business meaning)

Date_Closed → all NULL → assume active clubs

2. Core KPI Calculations (Top Tiles)
1️⃣ Total Clubs

Excel

=COUNTA(A:A)

DAX

Total Clubs = COUNT('Clubs'[Club_Key])
2️⃣ Active Clubs

(All clubs since Date_Closed is empty)

Active Clubs =
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('Clubs'[Club_Key]),
    ISBLANK('Clubs'[Date_Closed])
)
3️⃣ Clubs by State
Clubs by State =
COUNT('Clubs'[Club_Key])

(use state as dimension)

4️⃣ Clubs by District
Clubs by District =
COUNT('Clubs'[Club_Key])
5️⃣ Clubs by Box Type (Big Box / Small Box)
Clubs by Box =
COUNT('Clubs'[Club_Key])
3. Space & Size Metrics
6️⃣ Total Square Footage
Total Sq Ft = SUM('Clubs'[Sq_Ft])
7️⃣ Average Club Size
Avg Sq Ft = AVERAGE('Clubs'[Sq_Ft])
8️⃣ Avg Sq Ft by Box Type

(use Box in rows)

Avg Sq Ft by Box = AVERAGE('Clubs'[Sq_Ft])
4. Time-Based & Growth Metrics (Very Important for Dashboards)
9️⃣ Clubs Opened by Year

(use Year_Opened)

Clubs Opened = COUNT('Clubs'[Club_Key])

Visual: Column / Line chart

🔟 Club Age (Years Since Opened)

Calculated Column

Club Age (Years) =
DATEDIFF('Clubs'[Date_Opened], TODAY(), YEAR)
1️⃣1️⃣ Average Club Age
Avg Club Age = AVERAGE('Clubs'[Club Age (Years)])
1️⃣2️⃣ Time Taken to Open (Start → Open)

Calculated Column

Days to Open =
DATEDIFF('Clubs'[ClubStartDt], 'Clubs'[ClubOpenedDt], DAY)
1️⃣3️⃣ Average Days to Open
Avg Days to Open =
AVERAGE('Clubs'[Days to Open])
5. Presale Performance Metrics
1️⃣4️⃣ Presale Clubs Count
Presale Clubs =
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('Clubs'[Club_Key]),
    NOT ISBLANK('Clubs'[Presale_Date])
)
1️⃣5️⃣ Presale to Opening Duration

Calculated Column

Presale to Open (Days) =
DATEDIFF('Clubs'[Presale_Date], 'Clubs'[Date_Opened], DAY)
6. Financial / CIP Metrics
1️⃣6️⃣ Total CIP_G_L
Total CIP = SUM('Clubs'[CIP_G_L])
1️⃣7️⃣ Average CIP per Club
Avg CIP = AVERAGE('Clubs'[CIP_G_L])
7. Recommended Interactive Dashboard Layout
🎯 KPI Cards

Total Clubs

Avg Days to Open

📊 Charts

Clubs Opened by Year → Line Chart

Clubs by State → Map / Bar

Clubs by District → Bar

Big Box vs Small Box → Donut

Avg Sq Ft by Box Type → Bar

🎛 Filters / Slicers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ Total Checkins
🔍 Logic

Sum of all check-ins across all members and clubs.

✅ Case A: If Checkins column exists (numeric)
Excel
=SUM(Table1[Checkins])
Power BI (DAX Measure)
Total Checkins =
SUM('Checkins'[Checkins])
✅ Case B: If each row = 1 check-in (no Checkins column)
Excel
=COUNTA(Table1[Member_ID])
Power BI (DAX)
Total Checkins =
COUNTROWS('Checkins')
2️⃣ Avg Checkins by Member
🔍 Logic (Step-by-step)

Calculate total check-ins

Calculate distinct members

Divide total check-ins ÷ total members

✅ Excel
Step 1: Total Checkins
=SUM(Table1[Checkins])
Step 2: Distinct Members
=COUNTA(UNIQUE(Table1[Member_ID]))
Step 3: Average Checkins per Member
=SUM(Table1[Checkins]) / COUNTA(UNIQUE(Table1[Member_ID]))
✅ Power BI (DAX)
Step 1: Total Checkins
Total Checkins = SUM('Checkins'[Checkins])
Step 2: Total Members
Total Members =
DISTINCTCOUNT('Checkins'[Member_ID])
Step 3: Avg Checkins by Member
Avg Checkins by Member =
DIVIDE([Total Checkins], [Total Members])
3️⃣ Checkins by Club
🔍 Logic

Total check-ins grouped by each club.

✅ Excel (Pivot Table – Recommended)

Insert Pivot Table

Rows → Club_Name

Values → SUM of Checkins

OR Formula Version
=SUMIFS(Table1[Checkins], Table1[Club_Name], A2)

(A2 = club name)

✅ Power BI (DAX)
Checkins by Club =
SUM('Checkins'[Checkins])

📊 Use Club_Name on axis → works dynamically.

4️⃣ Avg Checkins by Club
🔍 Logic (Very Important)

Calculate check-ins per club

Calculate number of clubs

Divide total check-ins ÷ total clubs

✅ Excel
Step 1: Total Checkins
=SUM(Table1[Checkins])
Step 2: Distinct Clubs
=COUNTA(UNIQUE(Table1[Club_Name]))
Step 3: Avg Checkins per Club
=SUM(Table1[Checkins]) / COUNTA(UNIQUE(Table1[Club_Name]))
✅ Power BI (DAX)
Step 1: Total Clubs
Total Clubs =
DISTINCTCOUNT('Checkins'[Club_Name])
Step 2: Avg Checkins by Club
Avg Checkins by Club =
DIVIDE([Total Checkins], [Total Clubs])
✅ Final KPI Summary (Dashboard Ready)
KPI	Excel Formula	Power BI Measure
Total Checkins	SUM(Checkins)	SUM(Checkins)
Avg Checkins by Member	Total / Distinct Members	DIVIDE(Total, Members)
Checkins by Club	SUMIFS / Pivot	SUM(Checkins)
Avg Checkins by Club	Total / Distinct Clubs	DIVIDE(Total, Clubs)

Formula for Avg Days to Open :
Avg Days to Open =
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(
        Clubs,
        Clubs[Date_Opened] >= Clubs[Club_Start_Date]
    ),
    DATEDIFF(
        Clubs[Club_Start_Date],
        Clubs[Date_Opened],
        DAY
    )
)

Open Date Valid =
IF(
    Clubs[Date_Opened] >= Clubs[Club_Start_Date],
    "Valid",
    "Invalid"
)

DAX formula for club Status :
Club Status =
IF(
    ISBLANK(Clubs[Date_Closed]) || Clubs[Date_Closed] = "",
    "Active",
    "Closed"
)

Active Clubs =
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Clubs[Club_Key]),
    Clubs[Club Status] = "Active"
)

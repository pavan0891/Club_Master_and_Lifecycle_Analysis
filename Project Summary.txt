          📊 Project Title

Club Master & Lifecycle Analysis Dashboard

🧩 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a club master dataset containing lifecycle, geographic, and infrastructure details for multiple clubs. The objective was to design a clean analytical model and build an interactive dashboard that enables business users to monitor club expansion, operational status, and infrastructure distribution across regions.

The dataset represents one row per club and functions as a dimension-style master table, rather than a transactional dataset.

🎯 Business Objectives

Track total, active, and closed clubs

Analyze club distribution by geography (State, District)

Understand club lifecycle timelines (start, presale, opening, closure)

Compare club sizes and formats (Big Box vs Small Box)

Support strategic expansion and operations planning

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key attributes:

Club identifiers and names

Lifecycle dates (Club Start Date, Presale Date, Date Opened, Date Closed)

Geographic information (State, District)

Physical attributes (Square Footage, Box Type)

Opening year for trend analysis

The grain of the dataset is one record per club, making it suitable as a Club Dimension / Master table in a BI model.

🧠 Data Modeling Approach

Treated the dataset as a Club Dimension table

Clearly distinguished club lifecycle dates from member or transaction data

Designed the model to integrate seamlessly with future Fact tables such as:

POS Transactions

Member Check-ins

Ensured correct grain awareness to avoid invalid KPIs (e.g., member joins)

📐 Key Metrics & KPIs

🔍 Key Learnings & Best Practices

Importance of identifying data grain before defining KPIs

Difference between dimension vs fact tables

Proper use of lifecycle dates for time-based analysis

Designing dashboards that balance executive KPIs with operational insights
